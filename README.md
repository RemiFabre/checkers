# Checkers++
The goal of this project is to create a checkers-playing robot. This project is divided in several folders :

 - **Game** : C++ Port of [Checkers](https://github.com/Ziink4/checkers), a simple game engine for playing [English Draughts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_draughts)
 - **Vision** : [OpenCV](https://opencv.org)-based software tool used to acquire information about a checkerboard from a camera.
 - **Control** : All the necessary software to control the robot arm that will play the game physically.

*More information is available in each subdirectory.*
